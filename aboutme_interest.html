<li>Music is something I'm deeply interested in I listen to it everywhere I go and no matter what I'm doing whether it's coding or even sleeping it's being played. </li>

<li>Tech is also a big deal when it comes to my interest I like the software part more than the hardware even though they meet togther in the end  </li>
